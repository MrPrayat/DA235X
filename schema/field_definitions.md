# üìë Field Definitions

This document outlines the fields we extract from Swedish housing inspection reports, their meaning, expected JSON format, and explicit boolean semantics for key object‚Äëtype fields.

---

## Fields and Descriptions

### `CadastralDesignation`

The full legal name of the property, e.g., ‚ÄúStockholm Marevik 23‚Äù.

### `InspectionDate`

The date the inspection was conducted, in format **YYYY-MM** (year and month only).

### `MoistureDamage`

Object indicating whether water‚Äërelated issues appear in specific locations.

**Keys:**

- `mentions_garage`
- `mentions_k√§llare`
- `mentions_roof`
- `mentions_balcony`
- `mentions_bj√§lklag`
- `mentions_fasad`

**Boolean semantics:**

- **Default**: all keys are `false` unless evidence is found.
- Set a location key to `true` only if the report explicitly mentions water damage, leaks, moisture ingress, or similar terms in that area.
- Leave `false` if the area is not mentioned or explicitly described as dry/without issues.

### `RenovationNeeds`

Object indicating whether renovation work is needed in each area.

**Keys:**

- `roof`
- `garage`
- `facade`
- `balcony`
- `k√§llare`
- `bj√§lklag`

**Boolean semantics:**

- **Default**: all keys are `false` unless a clear need is stated.
- Set to `true` only when the text contains direct statements like ‚Äúb√∂r √•tg√§rdas‚Äù, ‚Äúi d√•ligt skick‚Äù, ‚Äúslitage‚Äù, or scheduled/planned renovation for that area.
- If the area is mentioned but noted as in good order, or is not mentioned, keep `false`.

### `AsbestosPresence`

Object describing asbestos mentions.

- `Measured`: `true` if a measurement or test for asbestos is explicitly described; otherwise `false`.
- `presence`: `true` if asbestos is mentioned anywhere; `false` if no mention.

### `SummaryInsights`

Free‚Äëtext summary (1‚Äì2 sentences) of the most important actionable renovation items.\
Set to `null` if no clear actions are described.
