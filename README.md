# ðŸ§¾ Extraction Scripts

This folder contains scripts for running PDF extraction of housing inspection reports using GPT-4o.

## Overview

We support two modes:

- `batch_extraction.py` â€“ Process multiple reports from `data/inspection_urls.csv`
- `run_single_extraction.py` â€“ Re-extract a specific PDF by its ID (e.g. for debugging)

All shared logic is located in `extraction_script.py`, but that file is no longer used directly by day-to-day workflows.

---

## ðŸ“„ `run_single_extraction.py`

Use this to manually re-extract specific PDFs.

### Example usage

```bash
python -m extraction.run_single_extraction
```

Inside the script, update the list of IDs:

```python
extract_specific_pdfs(["3578724"], csv_path="data/inspection_urls.csv")
```

Replace the array with any PDF IDs you need to reprocess.

---

## ðŸ“‚ `batch_extraction.py`

Use this to process multiple PDFs in bulk based on inspection report CSV.

### Example usage

```bash
python -m extraction.batch_extraction
```

Inside the script, configure:

```python
run_pdf_tests(
    test_amount=5,        # number of PDFs to run
    skip_existing=True,   # skip already extracted PDFs
)
```

- `test_amount`: how many PDFs to process
- `skip_existing`: if `True`, will skip PDFs with existing output
